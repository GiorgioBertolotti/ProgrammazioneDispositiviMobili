# QuakeApp
ðŸŽ“ðŸ“± Android App for earthquakes tracking

## App structure

The app has a main navigation with a [drawer](https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer), through it you can access the main 4 **fragments**:

- **Homepage**: Contains a carousel with informative cards, areas of interest and a preview of the latest earthquakes
- **All earthquakes**: Contains a list of earthquakes, it can be filtered and sorted for several fields
- **Latest earthquakes**: Contains a carousel of cards with info about earthquakes, a section with info about the strongest earthquake
- **Seismic networks**: Contains a list of *all* the seismic networks, when you tap on one, you can see the detail of it

We made several classes for retrieving data from APIs.  
The fragments interfaces with these classes to display the data from APIs.
